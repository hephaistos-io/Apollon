# Apollon
The basic idea of this library is to allow the automatic management and creation of _reports_ on your service of choice. For example, you can use this in combination with your own Exception handler, to allow your team to have an up to date tasklist on occurring bugs in the production environment. No need for the analysis of logs before you can find the problem!

The [original version](https://github.com/RicardoMonteiroSimoes/IssueReported) of this is old and was initially intended to be for GitHub only. With the time and experience, I decided that it would make more sense to have the core application in a library, and offer integration through single libraries. Another inspiration for this was seeing sentry.io being used for the frontend.

This is in active development and will have a release as soon as I deem it ready. Of course this will be parallel to an integration library, most likely GitHub integration as that is the easiest to do right now.
